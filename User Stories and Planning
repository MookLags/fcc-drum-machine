user stories and brainstorming:

1) I need an outer container with the id of "drum-machine" that contains everything else.
2) I also need a "#display" div which shows the button pressed and its corresponding sound
3) I need 9 clickable drum pad elements which each play a unique sound. These also need to be mapped to the 9 rightmost alphabetic computer keys.
4) Within each ".drum-pad" there should be an HTML5 audio element which has a src attribute pointing to an audio clip with a class name of "clip." Their id's should correstpond to the letter to which they are mapped.
5) Clicking on a ".drum-pad" element should trigger the sound.
6) So should pressing the associated key.
7) When a ".drum-pad" is triggered, the name of the sound should appear in the #display

Goals for this morning:
1) Learn to use the audio element
2) Map a sound to a button via click
3) Add styles for when button is active (css filter to change color)
4) Add #display
5) Add audio elements to Key components in Keyboard
